# Pedometer
This app is built using Jetpack Compose which tracks user's daily steps using `TYPE_STEP_COUNTER` sensor.
The app locally stores the steps history, also includes a bar chart to compare the progress against the set target. 
It uses [scrollablebarchart-compose](https://github.com/Varsha-Kulkarni/scrollablebarchart-compose) to plot the barchart.
